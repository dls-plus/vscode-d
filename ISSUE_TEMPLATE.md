<!--

Please check if your issue happens with a simple hello world project and send it in this issue.

If it is a formatting issue, it is probably related to dfmt. Possibly the embedded dfmt version in serve-d/workspace-d might be outdated.

If you are experiencing crashes, abnormal behaviour, etc. please open the Output panel in vscode and open the `code-d & serve-d` output. Please copy this log in a code block into this issue like this:

```
output here
```

If you can live with some sensitive information such as file paths and entire contents of files being shared, please go into your user settings and set `"serve-d.trace.server": "verbose"` (it will show it can't find it, but just ignore it). Also try to reproduce with a simple hello world project and send the output of it instead as it will be a lot smaller.
